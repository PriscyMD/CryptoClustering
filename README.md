# CryptoClustering

## An overview of the project and its purpose
### Youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1: Prepare the Data
### Part 2: Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
### Part 3: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
### Part 4: Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
### Part 5: Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
### Part 6: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes, with similar exercises on the third day of class, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code.
